The file `/api/index.ts` is used by Vercel to mount the Fastify routes in the backend. All API requests are routed to it via a rewrite rule in `vercel.json` at the top level of the project.

It is critical for the backend to be functional on Vercel Serverless. It should remain unchanged and in this location if the application is hosted by Appsmith.
